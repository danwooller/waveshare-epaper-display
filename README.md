### Connect the display

Turn the Pi off, then put the HAT on top of the Pi's GPIO pins.  

Connect the ribbon from the epaper display to the extension.  To do this you will need to lift the black latch at the back of the connector, insert the ribbon slowly, then push the latch down.  Now turn the Pi back on. 


## Setup dependencies

    sudo apt install git ttf-wqy-zenhei ttf-wqy-microhei python3 python3-pip python-imaging libopenjp2-7-dev libjpeg8-dev inkscape figlet wiringpi
    sudo pip3 install astral spidev RPi.GPIO Pillow  # Pillow took multiple attempts to install as it's always missing dependencies
    sudo pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    sudo sed -i s/#dtparam=spi=on/dtparam=spi=on/ /boot/config.txt  #This enables SPI
    sudo reboot

### Get the BCM2835 driver

    wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.58.tar.gz
    sudo tar zxvf bcm2835-1.58.tar.gz
    cd bcm2835-1.58/
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make check
    sudo make install

## Using this application

### Clone it

git clone this repository in the `/home/pi` directory.

    cd /home/pi
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/danwooller/waveshare-epaper-display.git
    
This should create a `/home/pi/waveshare-epaper-display` directory. 

### Waveshare version

Copy `env.sh.sample` (example environment variables) to `env.sh` 

Modify the `env.sh` file and set the version of your Waveshare 7.5" e-Paper Module  (newer ones are version 2)

    export WAVESHARE_EPD75_VERSION=2


### Climacell API key

Modify the `env.sh` file and put your [Climacell API key](https://www.climacell.co/weather-api/) in there.  

    export CLIMACELL_APIKEY=xxxxxx

Climacell API is used for the weather forecast as well as several weather icons.

### Location information for Weather

Modify the `env.sh` file and update with the latitude and longitude of your location. As needed, change the temperature format (CELSIUS or FAHRENHEIT).

    export WEATHER_FORMAT=CELSIUS
    export WEATHER_LATITUDE=51.3656
    export WEATHER_LONGITUDE=0.1963


### Google Calendar token

The Oauth process needs to complete once manually in order to allow the Python code to then continuously query Google Calendar for information. 
Go to the [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python) page and enable Google Calendar API.  When presented, download or copy the `credentials.json` file and add it to this directory. 

Next, SSH to the Raspberry Pi and run

    python3 screen-calendar-get.py

The script will prompt you to visit a URL in your browser and then wait.  Copy the URL, open it in a browser and you will go through the login process.  When the OAuth workflow tries to redirect back (and fails), copy the URL it was trying to go to (eg: http://localhost:8080/...) and in another SSH session with the Raspberry Pi, 

    curl "http://localhost:8080/..." 

On the first screen you should see the auth flow complete, and a new `token.pickle` file appears.  The Python script should now be able to run in the future without prompting required.  



### Run it

Run `./run.sh` which should query Climacell and Google Calendar.  It will then create a png, convert to a 1-bit black and white bmp, then display the bmp on screen. 

Using a 1-bit, low grade BMP is what allows the screen to refresh relatively quickly. Calling the BCM code to do it takes about 6 seconds. 
Rendering a high quality PNG or JPG and rendering to screen with Python takes about 35 seconds.  

### Automate it

Once you've proven that the run works, and an image is sent to your epaper display, you can automate it by setting up a cronjob.  

    crontab -e

Add this entry so it runs every minute:

    * * * * * cd /home/pi/waveshare-epaper-display && bash run.sh > run.log 2>&1

This will cause the script to run every minute, and write the output as well as errors to the run.log file. 


## Waveshare documentation and sample code

Waveshare have a [user manual](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/7/74/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-user-manual-en.pdf) which you can get to from [their Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT)


The [Waveshare demo repo is here](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper).  Assuming all dependencies are installed, these demos should work.  

    git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper
    cd e-Paper


This is the best place to start for troubleshooting - try to make sure the examples given in their repo works for you.
